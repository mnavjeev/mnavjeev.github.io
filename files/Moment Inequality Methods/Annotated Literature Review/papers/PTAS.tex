\section{A Effecient PTAS for Two-Strategy Anonymous Games \textit{\small Constantinos Daskalakis (ArXiv, 2008)}}

\citet{D-2008} was put on ArXiv in 2008. Much of the work was done while Daskalakis was a grad student at UC Berkeley. It can be found online \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2277}{here}. The paper presents a novel polynomial time approzimation scheme for two strategy anonymous games. 

\subsection{Introduction}

Recently been established that computing a Nash equilibrium is an intractable problem, even in the case of two-player games. In view of this hardness result, research has been directed to the computation of approximate Nash equilibria. These are action profiles in which no player has more than some small $\eps$ incentive to change her strategy. 

Despite much research in this direction, only constant $\eps$'s can be achieved in polynomial time. Yet, an approximate Nash equilibrium in which the players have regret equal to a significant fraction of their payoffs is not an attractive solution concept. On the contrary, if $\eps$ is small, then maybe there is a switching cost. So is there a Polynomial Time Approximation Schme for approximate Nash equilibria?
