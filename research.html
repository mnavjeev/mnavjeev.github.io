            <h3>Doubly Robust Inference for Conditional Average Treatment Effects with High-Dimensional Controls (with Adam Baybutt)</h3>                 
            <aside>	
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> 
                Plausible identification of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) often relies on controlling for a large number of variables to account for confounding factors. In these high-dimensional settings, estimation of the CATE requires estimating first-stage models whose consistency relies on correctly specifying their parametric forms. While doubly-robust estimators of the CATE exist, inference procedures based on the second stage CATE estimator are not doubly robust. Using the popular augmented inverse propensity weighting signal, we propose an estimator for the CATE whose resulting Wald-type confidence intervals are doubly robust. We assume a logistic model for the propensity score and a linear model for the outcome regression, and estimate the parameters of these models using an <span>&#8467;</span>1 (Lasso)  penalty to address the high dimensional covariates. Our proposed estimator remains consistent at the nonparametric rate and our proposed pointwise and uniform confidence intervals remain asymptotically valid even if one of the logistic propensity score or linear outcome regression models are misspecified. These results are obtained under similar conditions to existing analyses in the high-dimensional and nonparametric literatures. <a href="files/Papers/ModelCatePaper.pdf"><u>Draft</u></a>, <a href="files/Papers/yes_2022.pdf">Slides</a></p>

            <h3>Ordered, Unordered, and Minimal Monotonicity Criteria (with Rodrigo Pinto)</h3>
            <aside>	
                <p><b>Abstract:</b> This paper performs a comparative analysis between ordered and unordered choice models. We present non-trivial symmetries between ordered and unordered monotonicity conditions. We show that these seemingly unrelated models share a weaker and more general condition called <i>Minimal Monotonicity</i>. This novel condition captures an essential property for the identification analysis of causal parameters while being necessary to ascribe causal interpretation to Two Stage Least Squares estimands. We show that minimal monotonicity naturally arises from revealed preference analysis. The condition is associated with a notion of rationality and can serve as a theoretical foundation for a wide range of economic choice behaviors that do not conform with the narrative imposed by ordered or unordered choice models. <a href="files/Papers/Ord_Unord_Paper.pdf"><u>Draft</u></a></p>
