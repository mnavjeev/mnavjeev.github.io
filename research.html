                We study inference in models where a transformation of parameters exhibits first-order degeneracy
                &mdash; that is, its gradient is zero or close to zero, making the standard delta method invalid. A
                leading example is causal mediation analysis, where the indirect effect is a product of coefficients and
                the gradient degenerates near the origin. In these local regions of degeneracy the limiting behaviors of
                plug-in estimators depend on nuisance parameters that are not consistently estimable. We show that this
                failure is intrinsic &mdash; around points of degeneracy, both regular and quantile-unbiased estimation
                are impossible. Despite these restrictions, we develop minimum-distance methods that deliver uniformly
                valid confidence intervals. We establish sufficient conditions under which standard chi-square critical
                values remain valid, and propose a simple bootstrap procedure when they are not. We demonstrate
                favorable power in simulations and in an empirical application linking teacher gender attitudes to
                student outcomes.

                Using modifications of Lindeberg's interpolation technique, I propose a new identification-robust test
                for the structural parameter in a heteroskedastic instrumental variables model. While my analysis allows
                the number of instruments to be much larger than the sample size, it does not require many instruments,
                making my test applicable in settings that have not been well studied. Instead, the proposed test
                statistic has a limiting chi-squared distribution so long as an auxiliary parameter can be consistently
                estimated. This is possible using machine learning methods even when the number of instruments is much
                larger than the sample size. To improve power, a simple combination with the sup-score statistic of
                Belloni et al. (2012) is proposed. I point out that first-stage F-statistics calculated on LASSO
                selected variables may be misleading indicators of identification strength and demonstrate favorable
                performance of my proposed methods in both empirical data and simulation study.

                This paper develops a class of potential outcomes models characterized by three main features: (i)
                Unobserved heterogeneity can be represented by a vector of potential outcomes and a "type" describing
                the manner in which an instrument determines the choice of treatment; (ii) The availability of an
                instrumental variable that is conditionally independent of unobserved heterogeneity; and (iii) The
                imposition of convex restrictions on the distribution of unobserved heterogeneity. The proposed class of
                models encompasses multiple classical and novel research designs, yet possesses a common structure that
                permits a unifying analysis of identification and estimation. In particular, we establish that these
                models share a common necessary and sufficient condition for identifying certain causal parameters. Our
                identification results are constructive in that they yield estimating moment conditions for the
                parameters of interest. Focusing on a leading special case of our framework, we further show how these
                estimating moment conditions may be modified to be doubly robust. The corresponding double robust
                estimators are shown to be asymptotically normally distributed, bootstrap based inference is shown to be
                asymptotically valid, and the semi-parametric efficiency bound is derived for those parameters that are
                root-n estimable. We illustrate the usefulness of our results for developing, identifying, and
                estimating causal models through an empirical evaluation of the role of mental health as a mediating
                variable in the Moving To Opportunity experiment.

                    Plausible identification of conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) can rely on controlling
                    for a large number of variables to account for confounding factors. In these high-dimensional
                    settings, estimation of the CATE requires estimating first-stage models whose consistency relies on
                    correctly specifying their parametric forms. While doubly-robust estimators of the CATE exist,
                    inference procedures based on the second stage CATE estimator are not doubly robust. Using the
                    popular augmented inverse propensity weighting signal, we propose an estimator for the CATE whose
                    resulting Wald-type confidence intervals are doubly robust. We assume a logistic model for the
                    propensity score and a linear model for the outcome regression, and estimate the parameters of these
                    models using an <span>&#8467;</span>1 (Lasso) penalty to address the high dimensional covariates.
                    Our
                    proposed estimator remains consistent at the nonparametric rate and our proposed pointwise and
                    uniform confidence intervals remain asymptotically valid even if one of the logistic propensity
                    score or linear outcome regression models are misspecified.
